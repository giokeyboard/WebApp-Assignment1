            <p>We established iCare Foundation back in 2010, after reading reports of rising concerns about homelessness issues. We perform a number of activities that tackle homelessness. Due to the chronic lack of resources, we developed a fundraising base taking advantage of most recent peer-to-peer finance technologies. We are building a comprehensive social safety net, and in collaboration with individuals, business and corporate partners we lend a helping hand.</p>
